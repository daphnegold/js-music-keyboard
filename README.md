# Create a Javascript & jQuery Powered Music Player

## Project Skeleton
This example project includes foundational HTML & CSS. Open [index.html](index.html) to have a look at the layout. The goal of this project is to bind interactivity to the color boxes so that, when interacted with, they play a musical tone. :)

### Two kinds of interaction
We'll be binding two different kinds of interaction to the music boxes. Our initial goal will to be trigger the appropriate tone when someone __clicks__ inside a box. Once that is working we will extend the interaction to be triggered when someone __presses a key__ on the keyboard.
